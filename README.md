# Developers Note
As it stands this project is very outdated and can use some major changes and updates. I am planning a complete re-write in the not too distant future.

## Update

The base logger is now available in this repo. The completed design will have command and control functionality through two seperate third party services.

The development files for those and more can be found in the **Beta** directory.
